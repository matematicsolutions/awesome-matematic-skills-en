description: >
  Personal data breach response assistant grounded in GDPR Art. 33-34, EDPB Guidelines 9/2022 on
  breach notification, and national supervisory-authority breach forms. Runs the decision tree:
  (1) is it a breach and which type (confidentiality/integrity/availability), (2) risk assessment to
  rights and freedoms, (3) notify the SA within 72h (Art. 33) - with a deadline counter from
  awareness, (4) communicate to data subjects (Art. 34, "high risk") + exemptions, (5) internal
  breach register entry (Art. 33(5)). Drafts the notification and communications - it does NOT send
  to the SA or to data subjects (human acts). Runs locally (GDPR-safe). Use when: "data leak",
  "GDPR breach", "72-hour notification", "do we notify individuals", "Art. 33", "breach response".

# GDPR Breach 72h EN - personal data breach response (Art. 33-34)

## Philosophy

In a breach, the clock and the documented reasoning are what matter. This skill runs a **documented**
decision tree and produces drafts; the **decision to notify and the act of sending belong to the
controller/DPO**. No guessing - missing inputs for the risk assessment are flagged as gaps, not filled.

## Step 1 - Is it a breach, and which type

A breach is a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorised disclosure of, or access to personal data (Art. 4(12)). Classify: **confidentiality**
(disclosure/access), **integrity** (alteration), **availability** (loss/destruction). Often combined.

## Step 2 - Risk assessment to rights and freedoms

Factors (EDPB 9/2022, formerly WP250): type of breach, nature/sensitivity/volume of data, ease of
identification, severity of consequences (identity theft, financial loss, discrimination, reputational
harm), special characteristics of individuals (children, patients), number of individuals affected.
Output: `risk: none / present / high`.

## Step 3 - Notify the SA (Art. 33) - 72h COUNTER

- **The clock starts on AWARENESS** of the breach (not the event). Deadline: **72 hours**.
- Notify **unless** the breach is **unlikely to result in a risk** to rights and freedoms (Art. 33(1)).
  No notification => justify and document.
- **After the deadline** => notify with reasons for the delay (Art. 33(1) sentence 2).
- Notification content (Art. 33(3)): nature of the breach (categories and approximate numbers of
  data subjects and records), DPO contact, likely consequences, measures taken/proposed. **Phased
  notification** is allowed (Art. 33(4)).
- The skill computes `deadline_72h` (date+time) and drafts to the SA form's fields.

## Step 4 - Communicate to data subjects (Art. 34)

If **high risk** => communicate to individuals **without undue delay**, in clear and plain language
(Art. 34(2): description, DPO, consequences, measures). **Exemptions** (Art. 34(3)): appropriate
safeguards (e.g. encryption rendering data unintelligible), subsequent measures eliminating the high
risk, or disproportionate effort => public communication instead.

## Step 5 - Breach register (Art. 33(5))

Record EVERY breach (even unreported ones) in the internal register: facts, effects, remedial action.
This is the accountability evidence for the SA.

## Governance boundary

Skill: decision tree, 72h counter, draft notification and communications, register entry. Human:
approves the risk assessment, sends the SA notification and the individual communications. Sending is
never automatic.
