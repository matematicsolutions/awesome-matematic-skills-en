  Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) assistant grounded in GDPR Art. 35-36, the EDPB WP248
  rev.01 guidelines, and national supervisory-authority blacklists. Walks through: (1) the
  threshold test - is a DPIA REQUIRED (EDPB's 9 criteria, the ">=2" rule of thumb, Art. 35(3)
  mandatory cases, the SA's mandatory list), (2) the DPIA structure mandated by Art. 35(7)
  (systematic description, necessity & proportionality, risk assessment, mitigating measures),
  (3) the Art. 36 prior-consultation decision. Drafts the DPIA and a decision log - it does NOT
  make the controller's risk decision or file with the authority (those are human acts). Runs
  locally (GDPR-safe). Use when: "do I need a DPIA", "data protection impact assessment", "DPIA
  for profiling/CCTV/AI", "Art. 35 GDPR", "prior consultation", "high-risk processing".

# GDPR DPIA EN - Data Protection Impact Assessment (Art. 35-36)

## Philosophy

A DPIA is not a checkbox - it is a process for managing risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
persons. This skill runs the process and produces a **draft**; the residual-risk acceptance and the
go/no-go decision belong to the controller.

## Step 1 - Is a DPIA REQUIRED (Art. 35(1) threshold)

Mandatory where processing is **likely to result in a high risk**. Three routes:

1. **Supervisory authority's mandatory list** (Art. 35(4)) - each EU SA publishes a list of
   operations always requiring a DPIA. Check the relevant national list.
2. **EDPB's 9 criteria (WP248)** - rule of thumb: **>=2 criteria met => DPIA**. Criteria:
   evaluation/scoring, automated decisions with significant effect (Art. 22), systematic monitoring,
   sensitive/highly personal data, large-scale data, matching/combining datasets, vulnerable data
   subjects (children, employees), innovative technology (AI, IoT), preventing exercise of a right
   or use of a service.
3. **Art. 35(3)** - explicit cases: systematic and extensive evaluation (profiling), large-scale
   special-category/criminal data, large-scale systematic monitoring of public areas.

Output: `dpia_required: yes/no/recommended` + per-criterion justification.

## Step 2 - DPIA structure (Art. 35(7) minimum)

Four pillars:
- **(a) Systematic description** of the processing and its purposes (incl. legitimate interest if relied on).
- **(b) Necessity and proportionality** assessment against the purposes (minimisation, legal basis,
  purpose limitation, retention, data-subject rights, transfers).
- **(c) Risk assessment** to rights and freedoms (risk sources, confidentiality/integrity/
  availability scenarios; likelihood x severity).
- **(d) Measures** to address the risks and demonstrate compliance + residual risk.

Record the DPO's advice (Art. 35(2)) and any consultation with data subjects (Art. 35(9)).

## Step 3 - Prior consultation (Art. 36)

If **residual risk remains HIGH despite measures**, the controller MUST consult the supervisory
authority BEFORE processing. The skill drafts the consultation request (scope per Art. 36(3)) - but
a human files it (governance boundary).

## Tool - threshold screening (deterministic, offline)

Screen whether a DPIA is required with the script instead of judging by feel (zero dependencies, GDPR-safe):

```bash
python scripts/dpia_screening.py --criteria evaluation,sensitive,largescale
python scripts/dpia_screening.py --mandatory public_monitoring
```

Returns a `verdict` (required / recommended / not_required) per the EDPB ">=2" rule and the Art. 35(3) cases. Screening only, not a clearance - the controller documents the decision.

## Governance boundary

Skill: drafts the DPIA, classifies criteria, prepares the consultation request. Human: approves the
risk assessment, decides on deployment, signs and files. The outward act (filing with the SA) is
never automatic.
